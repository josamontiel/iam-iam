<!--
1. Incorrect Permissions Assignment
Issue: Users are granted more permissions than necessary, violating the principle of least privilege.
Solution: Review and audit user permissions regularly. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have only the permissions they need.
2. Weak Password Policies
Issue: Users are allowed to create weak passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
Solution: Enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements and regular password changes. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.
3. Inactive User Accounts
Issue: Inactive or former employee accounts remain active, posing a security risk.
Solution: Implement a process for regularly reviewing and deactivating inactive accounts. Integrate IAM with HR systems to automate account deactivation upon employee termination.
4. Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Issue: Relying solely on passwords for authentication can lead to security breaches.
Solution: Enable MFA to add an extra layer of security. Ensure users understand how to set up and use MFA.
5. Improper Configuration of IAM Policies
Issue: IAM policies are misconfigured, leading to unintended access permissions.
Solution: Carefully design and test IAM policies before applying them. Use policy templates and guidelines provided by IAM tools and platforms.
6. Unmanaged Privileged Accounts
Issue: Privileged accounts (e.g., admin accounts) are not properly managed, leading to potential abuse.
Solution: Use privileged access management (PAM) tools to monitor and control the use of privileged accounts. Implement time-limited access and require approvals for elevated permissions.
7. Lack of Regular Audits and Monitoring
Issue: IAM activities are not regularly audited or monitored, making it difficult to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
Solution: Set up regular audits and monitoring of IAM activities. Use IAM tools to generate reports and alerts for unusual access patterns.
8. Inadequate User Training and Awareness
Issue: Users are not properly educated about IAM practices, leading to mistakes and security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Provide regular training and awareness programs on IAM best practices. Ensure users understand the importance of secure password management and the use of MFA.
9. Failure to Implement Conditional Access Policies
Issue: Access policies do not account for different scenarios, such as accessing resources from untrusted locations.
Solution: Implement conditional access policies to enforce additional checks based on factors like location, device compliance, and user risk levels.
10. Complicated User Access Requests
Issue: The process for users to request access to resources is cumbersome, leading to delays and potential security workarounds.
Solution: Streamline the access request process using automated workflows and self-service portals. Ensure access requests are reviewed and approved in a timely manner.-->
